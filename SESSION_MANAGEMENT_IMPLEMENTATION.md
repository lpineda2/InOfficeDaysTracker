# Visit Session Management Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive session management to fix the duplicate entry issue when users leave for lunch and return. The system now treats office visits as continuous sessions that can be paused and resumed throughout the day.

## Key Changes

### 1. New `OfficeEvent` Structure
- Represents individual entry/exit events within a session
- Contains `entryTime`, `exitTime`, and calculated `duration`
- Multiple events can occur within a single office visit (session)

### 2. Enhanced `OfficeVisit` Model
- **Session-based approach**: Each visit can contain multiple entry/exit events
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy properties (`entryTime`, `exitTime`, `duration`) still work
- **New properties**:
  - `events`: Array of `OfficeEvent` objects
  - `isActiveSession`: Checks if currently in an active session (last event has no exit time)
- **New methods**:
  - `startNewSession()`: Begins a new entry event
  - `endCurrentSession()`: Completes the current entry event with exit time
  - `resumeSession()`: Convenience method to end current and start new

### 3. Redesigned `AppData.startVisit()`
**Before (Problematic Logic):**
- Created new visit for each entry
- Only checked for incomplete visits (duration == nil)
- Allowed multiple completed visits per day

**After (Session Management):**
- Checks if visit already exists for today
- If visit exists and has active session → prevent duplicate
- If visit exists but no active session → resume session (add new event)
- If no visit exists → create new visit with first session

### 4. Redesigned `AppData.endVisit()`
**Before:**
- Completed entire visit and created new record
- Cleared current visit state entirely

**After:**
- Ends current session within existing visit
- Updates visit in array (doesn't create new record)
- Clears current visit state (allows resumption later)

### 5. Updated Duplicate Prevention
- `addVisit()`: Now checks for active sessions instead of incomplete visits
- `cleanupDuplicateEntries()`: Consolidates multiple visits into single session-based visits
- `validateCurrentVisitConsistency()`: Session-aware validation

## How It Fixes the Lunch Break Issue

### Scenario: User goes to lunch and returns

**Before (Problematic):**
1. User arrives → creates Visit A (incomplete)
2. User leaves for lunch → completes Visit A (with exit time)
3. User returns → sees "no incomplete visits" → creates Visit B
4. Race condition: Both LocationService and LocationVerificationService might detect return → potential duplicate Visit B

**After (Session Management):**
1. User arrives → creates Visit A with Session 1 (active)
2. User leaves for lunch → ends Session 1 in Visit A
3. User returns → finds existing Visit A → starts Session 2 in Visit A
4. No race condition: Both services will find the same Visit A and either resume it or detect it's already resumed

### Benefits

1. **Eliminates Duplicate Entries**: Only one visit record per day
2. **Preserves All Data**: Multiple entry/exit events are tracked within sessions
3. **Better Analytics**: Total office time per day is more accurate
4. **Handles Complex Scenarios**: Multiple breaks, not just lunch
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing data continues to work
6. **Race Condition Safe**: Multiple services can't create conflicting records

## Data Migration

- **Automatic**: Existing visits are automatically converted during `cleanupDuplicateEntries()`
- **No Data Loss**: Legacy format is preserved in encoding for compatibility
- **Gradual Transition**: New visits use session format, old visits work unchanged

## UI Compatibility

All existing UI components continue to work because:
- Legacy properties (`entryTime`, `exitTime`, `duration`) are computed from events
- `isValidVisit` logic remains the same (1+ hours total)
- Display formats unchanged (`formattedDuration`, `formattedDate`)

## Testing Scenarios

1. **New User**: Creates session-based visits from start
2. **Existing User**: Legacy visits work, new visits use sessions
3. **Lunch Break**: Single visit with multiple events, no duplicates
4. **Multiple Breaks**: All breaks tracked within one visit session
5. **Cross-Service Detection**: LocationService and LocationVerificationService work harmoniously

This implementation provides a robust foundation for office visit tracking that scales with user behavior while maintaining data integrity and preventing the duplicate entry bug.
