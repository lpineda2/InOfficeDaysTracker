# Bug Fixes Summary - In Office Days Tracker

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Location Service Permission Issues

**Problem**: The location service settings only showed "Never" and "When I share" options instead of the expected "Always" option. The permission button in the setup screen was not functional.

**Root Cause**: iOS requires a specific permission flow where apps must first request "When in Use" permission before being able to request "Always" permission. The app was trying to request both simultaneously.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `LocationService.swift` to implement a proper permission request flow:
  - First requests "When in Use" permission for new users
  - Adds a small delay (0.5 seconds) after getting "When in Use" before requesting "Always"
  - This delay ensures the first permission is properly processed by iOS
  - When permissions are denied, the app properly redirects to Settings

**Code Changes**:
```swift
func requestLocationPermission() {
    switch authorizationStatus {
    case .notDetermined:
        // First request "When in Use" permission
        locationManager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
    case .denied, .restricted:
        openAppSettings()
    case .authorizedWhenInUse:
        // After getting "When in Use", request "Always" permission
        // Add a small delay to ensure the first permission is processed
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {
            self.locationManager.requestAlwaysAuthorization()
        }
    case .authorizedAlways:
        break
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}
```

### 2. CoreGraphics NaN Errors

**Problem**: Multiple CoreGraphics NaN (Not a Number) errors were appearing in the debug console, indicating invalid numeric values were being passed to graphics APIs.

**Root Cause**: Division operations and percentage calculations could result in NaN or infinite values when dealing with empty data sets or zero values.

**Solutions**:

1. **Enhanced CircularProgressView**: Added `safePercentage` and `safePercentageDisplay` computed properties to sanitize percentage values:
```swift
private var safePercentage: Double {
    guard !percentage.isNaN && !percentage.isInfinite && percentage >= 0 else { return 0.0 }
    return min(percentage, 1.0)
}

private var safePercentageDisplay: Int {
    let displayValue = Int(safePercentage * 100)
    return max(0, min(100, displayValue))
}
```

2. **Fixed Average Duration Calculation**: Added NaN and infinite value checks:
```swift
private func getAverageDuration() -> Double {
    let validVisits = appData.getValidVisits(for: Date())
    guard !validVisits.isEmpty else { return 0.0 }
    
    let totalDuration = validVisits.compactMap { $0.duration }.reduce(0, +)
    let count = Double(validVisits.count)
    guard count > 0 else { return 0.0 }
    
    let average = (totalDuration / count) / 3600 // Convert to hours
    guard !average.isNaN && !average.isInfinite else { return 0.0 }
    return average
}
```

3. **Enhanced Duration Formatting**: Added validation for duration values in both `OfficeVisit.swift` and `MainProgressView.swift`:
```swift
// In OfficeVisit.swift
var formattedDuration: String {
    guard let duration = duration else { return "In progress" }
    guard !duration.isNaN && !duration.isInfinite && duration >= 0 else { return "Invalid duration" }
    let hours = Int(duration / 3600)
    let minutes = Int((duration.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 3600)) / 60)
    return String(format: "%dh %dm", hours, minutes)
}

// In MainProgressView.swift
private func formatCurrentVisitDuration(_ visit: OfficeVisit) -> String {
    let duration = Date().timeIntervalSince(visit.entryTime)
    guard !duration.isNaN && !duration.isInfinite && duration >= 0 else { return "Invalid duration" }
    let hours = Int(duration / 3600)
    let minutes = Int((duration.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 3600)) / 60)
    return String(format: "%dh %dm", hours, minutes)
}
```

4. **Fixed Pace Calculation**: Added comprehensive guards for division operations:
```swift
private func calculatePace() -> String {
    guard daysLeft > 0 && remaining > 0 else { 
        if remaining <= 0 {
            return "Goal complete!"
        } else {
            return "0.0 days/week"
        }
    }
    let pace = Double(remaining) / Double(daysLeft)
    guard !pace.isNaN && !pace.isInfinite else { return "0.0 days/week" }
    return String(format: "%.1f days/week", pace * 7)
}
```

### 3. Build Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Xcode build was failing due to duplicate Info.plist files.

**Solution**: Removed the manual Info.plist file to let Xcode generate it automatically. The location permission keys can be added through the project settings when needed for device testing.

## Testing Instructions

### For Location Permissions:
1. Test on a physical device (location permissions don't work properly in the simulator)
2. During setup, when prompted for location permissions:
   - First tap will request "When in Use" permission
   - Grant "When in Use" when prompted
   - The app will automatically request "Always" permission after a brief delay
   - Grant "Always" permission to enable background tracking
3. If permissions are denied, the app will offer to open Settings

### For NaN Error Verification:
1. Monitor the debug console for CoreGraphics errors
2. Test edge cases like:
   - No visits recorded yet
   - Setting impossible goals (0 or negative)
   - Very short office visits
   - Rapid entry/exit from office location

## Status
- âœ… Build successful
- âœ… Location permission flow improved
- âœ… CoreGraphics NaN errors addressed
- âœ… All mathematical operations protected against invalid values
- ðŸ§ª Ready for device testing

## Next Steps
1. Test on a physical device to verify location permission flow
2. Test geofencing functionality with real location data
3. Verify UI displays correctly with real usage data
4. Monitor for any additional edge cases during testing
